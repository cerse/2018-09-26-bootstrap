## Outputs from group discussion activities

### 4. Growing our community / inclusion and support

**Facilitator: Andy Turner**

* Highlight 1: Diversity
  -  A community that has the widest diversity of people and is inclusive (both leading and in the membership) will have the most benefit and impact
  - How could this be achieved?
    + Explicitly highlight diversity and inclusivity as a goal of the community (in all publicity material and at events)
    + When writing event invitations make sure the variery of people who can come is explicitly
    stated to try and mitigate risk of people not thinking the event is for them
    + Run a diverse range of events with a variety of different timings to allow different groups to be involved in the
    community (for example, events that are labelled as *Training* will attract a different audience and potentially make
    it easier for people to argue for time away from their job to come along).
    + Look at how Women in HPC have achieved this as they have been very successful.
    + Produce or point to career profiles showing a diversity of people in the community.
  - Ideas for different event types:
    + RSE training - more advanced than the Carpentries
    + Joint event with UoE Staff Pride
    + Joint evert with local Women in HPC Chapter
    + Edinburgh DataFest Fring events: one for RSE community, one for wider community where they bring their problems to
    local RSEs
    + Hackathon style events with communities such as: City Council (WCDI?), NHS: bring together problems and 
    problem solvers
* Highlight 2: Inclusivity
  - Coming along to a community event such as this can be difficult for people as they may not feel part of the
  "club". There can be certain level of clique-iness associated with "movements" (e.g. RSE, Carpentries)
  - How can we avoid this?
    + Make sure our publicity text does not have these sorts of connatations and is welcoming and inclusive for all.
    + Have advocates for the community in institutions/departments that will raise the profile of the community from
    a source that potential members already know and trust.
    + Make sure events are run at different locations throughout Edinburgh (institutions, campuses, etc.).
    + Have events where members are encourgaed to bring a friend who has not attended before.
* Highlight 3: Growing the community
  - Can be difficult to reach out to people who do not already know about the community
  - Options:
    + This may naturally get better as the community grows and members disseminate information.
    + We could have reciprocal dissemination agreements with other, related groups: PyData Edinburgh, R Edinburgh,
    Carpentries, UK RSE, ARCHER/Cirrus. We need to find out who these communities are.
* Highlight 4: Support
  - How can we help less experienced community members grow their skills and develop their career/network?
  - Mentoring programme:
    + Pair less experienced community members with more experienced ones
    + Value in having mentors in different organisation/departments to help get diversity of views and to allow
    mentee(?!) more freedom to ask questions
* Things that we are missing:
  - Network organisation effort/skills:
    + Skills in dissemination, advertising, socila media, organising events, community adminstration
    + Could we put a funding proposal together to get money to support (part?) of a person to take on this role?
    + Would maybe also facilitate the mentoring scheme mentioned above?
  - Bursaries for less experienced community members to travel to relevant events (e.g. RSE conference) that they 
  may struggle to find funding for.
